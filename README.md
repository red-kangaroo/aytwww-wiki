# Wikipedia Companion #

The ideal tool for the lazy Wikipedia lover!

Wikipedia Companion lets you keep tabs on what all the fuss
is about on Wikipedia right now, without you needing to go
on Wikipedia and risking getting sucked down the labyrinth
of endless interesting [hyperlinks](https://xkcd.com/214/ "Better not click on this one.").

Check out the [GitHub page](https://red-kangaroo.github.io/aytwww-wiki/ "Wikipedia Companion").
Select a date and you will be presented with a list of
the most popular pages for that day by the number of visitors.
You can click on an interesting title to display an excerpt
from that page. A history of your articles will also be saved,
so that you can come back to them later.

This page was created as a project for the AYTWWW class.
